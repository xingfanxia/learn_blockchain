# Mechanics of Bitcoin

## Part 1 Bitcoin Transactions

### Recap: Bitcoin consensus

Bitcoin consensus gives us:

- Append-only ledger
- Decentralized consensus
- Miners to validate transactions

**Assuming a currency exists to motivate miners**

### An account-based ledger (not Bitcoin)

- We have to look over all transactions back there till the beginning of time to figure out if `Alice` has enough coins.
- Even if we put some data structure to keep track of `Alice's` balance, there is a lot more housing keeping despite the blockchain itself.
- So bitcoin does not use this model.

### An transaction-based ledger (Bitcoin)

- Always completely consume the input by giving an equal output.
- Can trace back much easier by looking at the input pointer to check if the transaction is valid
- Implemented with hash pointers

#### Joint Payments

- Consume two inputs to joint pay `David`
- So needs two signatures as came from two different people

### Real deal: a Bitcoin transaction(very very close version)
